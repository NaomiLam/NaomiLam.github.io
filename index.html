											<h2>About Me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I’m Naomi Lam, a third year pre-service teacher of Technology and Applied Studies (TAS) at ACU in Sydney, Australia.
										   Why do I think TAS is the best subject to teach?
										   Not only do students love getting hands on experience in a range of different technologies, they get to solve real world problems, which gives them authentic learning experiences.</p>

								<p class="content">I became a TAS Teacher because I am passionate about teaching students how to cook delicious, nutritious food. I want to show them the easiest way to peel an onion, the best way to poach an egg, and get them to experience the vast array of fabulous produce we have in Australia. I am excited about designing and making projects with students that explore digital technologies, timber technologies, agriculture, engineering, and wonderful textile technologies. Teaching TAS is so rewarding as we are supporting, nurturing and educating young people who will one day make designs that change the world. While at ACU I have received a commendation for achieving a 6.09 grade point average, and received an invitation to join the Golden Key Honour Society for achieving in the top 10% of students. I am so fortunate to have won the King & Amy O’Malley Trust Scholarship which supports high achieving Food Technology and Textiles Technology undergraduate teachers.</p>

									<h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
									<p>The TAS Teaching discipline is founded on the basis of the Design Process. <br /> 
										TAS uses the Design Process in Project Based Learning to explore real world problems that students can design solutions to using the technologies they are learning about.<br />
										What is the Design Process? <br />
										Textbooks say the Design Process looks like this:</p>
										
										<span class="image"><img width="460" height="460" src="images/Design diagram.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										
										<p>When in reality, the Design Process is more like this:</p>
										
										<span class="image"><img width="600" height="460"src="images/Real Design Process.gif" alt="" /></span>
										
										<p>I know from experiencing the Design Process myself that the struggle is real! <br />
										But when you finish those projects it's so rewarding.</p>
										<p class="content">In TAS I believe that students need hands on experience in designing and crafting their own projects. They need space to explore, experiment and to fail. We end up learning so much more from our failures than we do our successes. I want to encourage the curiosity of my students and expand their understanding of the world around them.
										My teaching philosophy is grounded in an ethical, empathetic approach that recognises the diversity of students, accommodates their different learning styles, and connects to them as individuals.</p>	
									</header>
									<h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
									<p>I love John Dewey’s approach to learning and it forms the basis of my teaching philosophy. <br /> 
										John Dewey’s philosophy of education was developed over 100 years ago, but it is still so relevant today. <br />
										Watch this quick video from Sprouts explaining his 4 principles of education.</p>
